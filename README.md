# MediBox
MediBox is the project that I had done for the module EN2853-Embedded Systems and Applications. This project utilizes the Wokwi platform for simulation and development. Medibox alerts patients when it's time to take their medicine through the buzzer sound, helping ensure timely and accurate medication adherence.
This solution is ideal for patients who struggle with remembering their medication schedules or require multiple daily doses. The project aims to enhance health management and patient well-being with a simple yet effective reminder system.
