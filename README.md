# MediBox
MediBox is the project that I had done for the module EN2853-Embedded Systems and Applications. This project utilizes the Wokwi platform for simulation and development. Medibox alerts patients when it's time to take their medicine through the buzzer sound, helping ensure timely and accurate medication adherence.
